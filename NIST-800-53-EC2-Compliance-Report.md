## üìå High-Priority Remediation Actions

1. **Disable Unused Services**
   - Disable or remove services like `rsync`, `avahi-daemon`, and any other non-essential daemons.
   - **Related NIST Control**: CM-7

2. **Harden SSH Configuration**
   - Set `PermitRootLogin no`, `X11Forwarding no`, and enforce strong ciphers.
   - **Related NIST Control**: AC-17, SC-12

3. **Implement Password Aging & Complexity Policies**
   - Enforce password expiration, history, and complexity via `/etc/login.defs` or PAM.
   - **Related NIST Control**: IA-2, IA-5

4. **Enhance Logging & Monitoring**
   - Forward logs to a centralized system.
   - Consider using CloudWatch Logs or a SIEM.
   - **Related NIST Control**: AU-6, SI-4

## üìò Notes

- This mapping uses CIS controls as a proxy for NIST 800-53 alignment. For formal audits, additional documentation, processes, and evidence are required.
- For cloud-native implementations, consider layering in AWS-specific services (e.g., GuardDuty, Config, CloudTrail) to bolster coverage.
